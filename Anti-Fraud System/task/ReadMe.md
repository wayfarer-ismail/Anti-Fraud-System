# Anti-Fraud System

This project is a simple anti-fraud system built with Java, Gradle, and Spring Boot. The main purpose of this project is to provide a practical learning experience for Spring Security and backend development.

## Technologies Used

- Gradle: Gradle is used as the build tool for this project.
- Spring Boot: This project uses Spring Boot, which simplifies the setup and development of Spring applications.

## Learning Objectives

The primary learning objectives of this project are:

- **Spring Security**: This project is a great opportunity to learn and understand the workings of Spring Security. It includes the configuration of security for different API endpoints and the use of different types of authentication.
- **Backend Development**: This project covers various aspects of backend development such as creating RESTful APIs, interacting with a database, and handling transactions.
